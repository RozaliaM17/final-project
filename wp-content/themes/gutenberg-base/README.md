# Gutenberg Base by DevriX
This is still a small beginner project that needs a lot of work to grow.

To begin work on it, all you need is to install the local packages with `npm i`. Ideally, use recent Node version (15, 16), but it's not unlikely that older ones would work as well.

## Goal
At the moment, the goal of the base theme is to be developer-focused. Meaning - more of the settings, styles and adjustments would happen in code.

In the future, we can move them to Customizer. To make this translation easy, we will develop with configuration in mind - use CSS Variables, settings and related. We can later tie to them to the customizer.
